as co-occurrence of suspected infection and a SOFA increase of two or more points. We followed the approach of the original authors as closely as possible1 3. Suspected infection was defined as co-occurrence of antibiotic treatment and body fluid sampling. If antibiotic treatment occurred first, it needed to be followed by fluid sampling within 24 hours. Alternatively, if fluid sampling occurred first, it needed to be followed by antibiotic treatment within 72 hours in order for it to be classified as suspected infection. The earlier of the two times is taken as the suspected infection (SI) time. After this, the SI window is defined to begin 48 hours before the SI time and end 24 hours after the SI time.","comments":"No temporal overlap with COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nProvided in supp data: SNOMED codes\n\nThe Emory dataset of the Physionet 2019 computing in Cardiology challenge  discarded because only 34 out of 64 variables available.\n\nImporta unit synchronization!\n\nThey derive to scores manually,  SOFA and SOFA deterioration, wich happen to be the ones influencing the model the most.
