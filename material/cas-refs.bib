However, many publications compare a new proposition—if at all—with one or two competitors, or even with a so-called “na\"{\i}ve” ad hoc solution, but fail to clarify the exact problem definition. As a consequence, even if two solutions are thoroughly compared experimentally, it will often remain unclear whether both solutions tackle the same problem or, if they do, whether they agree in certain tacit assumptions and how such assumptions may influence the outcome of an algorithm. In this survey, we try to clarify: (i) the different problem definitions related to subspace clustering in general; (ii) the specific difficulties encountered in this field of research; (iii) the varying assumptions, heuristics, and intuitions forming the basis of different approaches; and (iv) how several prominent solutions tackle different problems.},

In this paper, we show that unsupervised methods, in particular hidden Markov models, can go beyond this by guiding the generation of clinical outcome measures and hypotheses, which play a crucial role in medical research. The usage of the data-driven approach facilitates selecting which hypotheses to further investigate. We demonstrate this by using clinical trial data for psychotic depression treatment as a case study. The discovered latent structure and proposed outcome are shown to provide new insight into the heterogeneity of psychotic depression in terms of predictive symptoms.",

abstract = {•Sampling-based dimensionality reduction technique.•Eliminating linearly redundant combined dimensions.•Providing a convenient way to generate correlated multivariate random variables.•Maintaining the integrity of the original information.•Reducing the dimension of data space without losing important information.
The recent trends in collecting huge and diverse datasets have created a great challenge in data analysis. One of the characteristics of these gigantic datasets is that they often have significant amounts of redundancies. The use of very large multi-dimensional data will result in more noise, redundant data, and the possibility of unconnected data entities. To efficiently manipulate data represented in a high-dimensional space and to address the impact of redundant dimensions on the final results, we propose a new technique for the dimensionality reduction using Copulas and the LU-decomposition (Forward Substitution) method. The proposed method is compared favorably with existing approaches on real-world datasets: Diabetes, Waveform, two versions of Human Activity Recognition based on Smartphone, and Thyroid Datasets taken from machine learning repository in terms of dimensionality reduction and efficiency of the method, which are performed on statistical and classification measures.},

Subjects include supervised learning; Bayesian decision theory; parametric, semi-parametric, and nonparametric methods; multivariate analysis; hidden Markov models; reinforcement learning; kernel machines; graphical models; Bayesian estimation; and statistical testing.Machine learning is rapidly becoming a skill that computer science students must master before graduation. The third edition of Introduction to Machine Learning reflects this shift, with added support for beginners, including selected solutions for exercises and additional example data sets (with code available online). Other substantial changes include discussions of outlier detection; ranking algorithms for perceptrons and support vector machines; matrix decomposition and spectral methods; distance estimation; new kernel algorithms; deep learning in multilayered perceptrons; and the nonparametric approach to Bayesian methods. All learning algorithms are explained so that students can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The book can be used by both advanced undergraduates and graduate students. It will also be of interest to professionals who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods.},

abstract = "Feature selection is of great importance for two possible scenarios: (1) prediction, i.e., improving (or minimally degrading) the predictions of a target variable while discarding redundant or uninformative features and (2) discovery, i.e., identifying features that are truly dependent on the target and may be genuine causes to be determined in experimental verifications (for example for the task of drug target discovery in genomics). In both cases, if variables have a large number of missing values, imputing them may lead to false positives; features that are not associated with the target become dependent as a result of imputation. In the first scenario, this may not harm prediction, but in the second one, it will erroneously select irrelevant features. In this paper, we study the risk/benefit trade-off of missing value imputation in the context of feature selection, using causal graphs to characterize when structural bias arises. Our aim is also to investigate situations in which imputing missing values may be beneficial to reduce false negatives, a situation that might arise when there is a dependency between feature and target, but the dependency is below the significance level when only complete cases are considered. However, the benefits of reducing false negatives must be balanced against the increased number of false positives. In the case of binary target variable and continuous features, the t-test is often used for univariate feature selection. In this paper, we also introduce a de-biased version of the t-test allowing us to reap the benefits of imputation, while not incurring the penalty of increasing the number of false positives."

abstract = {The size of medical datasets is usually very large, which directly affects the computational cost of the data mining process. Instance selection is a data preprocessing step in the knowledge discovery process, which can be employed to reduce storage requirements while also maintaining the mining quality. This process aims to filter out outliers (or noisy data) from a given (training) dataset. However, when the dataset is very large in size, more time is required to accomplish the instance selection task.
In this paper, we introduce an efficient data preprocessing approach (EDP), which is composed of two steps. The first step is based on training a model over a small amount of training data after preforming instance selection. The model is then used to identify the rest of the large amount of training data.
Experiments are conducted based on two medical datasets for breast cancer and protein homology prediction problems that contain over 100000 data samples. In addition, three well-known instance selection algorithms are used, IB3, DROP3, and genetic algorithms. On the other hand, three popular classification techniques are used to construct the learning models for comparison, namely the CART decision tree, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM).
The results show that our proposed approach not only reduces the computational cost by nearly a factor of two or three over three other state-of-the-art algorithms, but also maintains the final classification accuracy.
To perform instance selection over large scale medical datasets, it requires a large computational cost to directly execute existing instance selection algorithms. Our proposed EDP approach solves this problem by training a learning model to recognize good and noisy data. To consider both computational complexity and final classification accuracy, the proposed EDP has been demonstrated its efficiency and effectiveness in the large scale instance selection problem.},

ML algorithms have never been better promised while challenged by big data. Big data enables ML algorithms to uncover more fine-grained patterns and make more timely and accurate predictions than ever before; on the other hand, it presents major challenges to ML such as model scalability and distributed computing. In this paper, we introduce a framework of ML on big data (MLBiD) to guide the discussion of its opportunities and challenges. The framework is centered on ML which follows the phases of preprocessing, learning, and evaluation. In addition, the framework is also comprised of four other components, namely big data, user, domain, and system. The phases of ML and the components of MLBiD provide directions for identification of associated opportunities and challenges and open up future work in many unexplored or under explored research areas.},

In addition, we perform preliminary cluster analysis of outliers. The most important motivation behind this paper is the potential use of these methods in real clinical setting within an automatic early warning system to potentially decrease the in-hospital mortality rates. Investigation of the outlier clustering is an important step towards the outlier analysis that will help finding out the cause of these outliers: a human error in the records, a technical mistake in the lab, or an actual complication of a patient’s disease. Our results demonstrate that specific clustering algorithms achieve a moderate performance in critical patient detection (F1 scores 0.489 for DBSCAN and 0.495 for k-means). The patient classification boundary is very complex and could not be accurately detected by thesealgorithms, but there are methods capable to determine such boundaries, e.g. the high-degree polynomial kernel SVM. Regarding the outlier clustering, we perform a preliminary analysis showing that it is a viable option for potential outlier classification and analysis."

abstract = {Data collected in psychological studies are mainly characterized by containing a large number of variables (multidimensional data sets). Analyzing multidimensional data can be a difficult task, especially if only classical approaches are used (hypothesis tests, analyses of variance, linear models, etc.). Regarding multidimensional models, visual techniques play an important role because they can show the relationships among variables in a data set. Parallel coordinates and Chernoff faces are good examples of this. This article presents self-organizing maps (SOM), a multivariate visual data mining technique used to provide global visualizations of all the data. This technique is presented as a tutorial with the aim of showing its capabilities, how it works, and how to interpret its results. Specifically, SOM analysis has been applied to analyze the data collected in a study on the efficacy of a cognitive and behavioral treatment (CBT) for childhood obesity. The objective of the CBT was to modify the eating habits and level of physical activity in a sample of children with overweight and obesity. Children were randomized into two treatment conditions: CBT traditional procedure (face-to-face sessions) and CBT supported by a web platform. In order to analyze their progress in the acquisition of healthier habits, self-register techniques were used to record dietary behavior and physical activity. In the traditional CBT condition, children completed the self-register using a paper-and-pencil procedure, while in the web platform condition, participants completed the self-register using an electronic personal digital assistant. Results showed the potential of SOM for analyzing the large amount of data necessary to study the acquisition of new habits in a childhood obesity treatment. Currently, the high prevalence of childhood obesity points to the need to develop strategies to manage a large number of data in order to design procedures adapted to personal characteristics and increase treatment efficacy.},

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles.

abstract = {Cluster analysis aims at identifying groups of similar objects and, therefore helps to discover distribution of patterns and interesting correlations in large data sets. It has been subject of wide research since it arises in many application domains in engineering, business and social sciences. Especially, in the last years the availability of huge transactional and experimental data sets and the arising requirements for data mining created needs for clustering algorithms that scale and can be applied in diverse domains.This paper introduces the fundamental concepts of clustering while it surveys the widely known clustering algorithms in a comparative way. Moreover, it addresses an important issue of clustering process regarding the quality assessment of the clustering results. This is also related to the inherent features of the data set under concern. A review of clustering validity measures and approaches available in the literature is presented. Furthermore, the paper illustrates the issues that are under-addressed by the recent algorithms and gives the trends in clustering process.},

abstract = {A cluster operator takes a set of data points and partitions the points into clusters (subsets). As with any scientific model, the scientific content of a cluster operator lies in its ability to predict results. This ability is measured by its error rate relative to cluster formation. To estimate the error of a cluster operator, a sample of point sets is generated, the algorithm is applied to each point set and the clusters evaluated relative to the known partition according to the distributions, and then the errors are averaged over the point sets composing the sample. Many validity measures have been proposed for evaluating clustering results based on a single realization of the random-point-set process. In this paper we consider a number of proposed validity measures and we examine how well they correlate with error rates across a number of clustering algorithms and random-point-set models. Validity measures fall broadly into three classes: internal validation is based on calculating properties of the resulting clusters; relative validation is based on comparisons of partitions generated by the same algorithm with different parameters or different subsets of the data; and external validation compares the partition generated by the clustering algorithm and a given partition of the data. To quantify the degree of similarity between the validation indices and the clustering errors, we use Kendall's rank correlation between their values. Our results indicate that, overall, the performance of validity indices is highly variable. For complex models or when a clustering algorithm yields complex clusters, both the internal and relative indices fail to predict the error of the algorithm. Some external indices appear to perform well, whereas others do not. We conclude that one should not put much faith in a validity score unless there is evidence, either in terms of sufficient data for model estimation or prior model knowledge, that a validity measure is well-correlated to the error rate of the clustering algorithm.},

abstract = {Microarray technology has been widely applied in biological and clinical studies for simultaneous monitoring of gene expression in thousands of genes. Gene clustering analysis is found useful for discovering groups of correlated genes potentially co-regulated or associated to the disease or conditions under investigation. Many clustering methods including hierarchical clustering, K-means, PAM, SOM, mixture model-based clustering and tight clustering have been widely used in the literature. Yet no comprehensive comparative study has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.
In this paper, six gene clustering methods are evaluated by simulated data from a hierarchical log-normal model with various degrees of perturbation as well as four real datasets. A weighted Rand index is proposed for measuring similarity of two clustering results with possible scattered genes (i.e. a set of noise genes not being clustered). Performance of the methods in the real data is assessed by a predictive accuracy analysis through verified gene annotations. Our results show that tight clustering and model-based clustering consistently outperform other clustering methods both in simulated and real data while hierarchical clustering and SOM perform among the worst. Our analysis provides deep insight to the complicated gene clustering problem of expression profile and serves as a practical guideline for routine microarray cluster analysis.},

abstract = {Web sites provide the key interface for consumer use of the Internet. This research reports on a series of three studies that developand validate Web site usability, design and performance metrics, including download delay, navigability, site content, interactivity, and responsiveness. The performance metric that was developed includes the subconstructs user satisfaction, the likelihood of return, and the frequency of use.
Data was collected in 1997, 1999, and 2000 from corporate Web sites via three methods, namely, a jury, third-party ratings, and a software agent. Significant associations between Web site design elements and Web site performance indicate that the constructs demonstrate good nomological validity. Together, the three studies provide a set of measures with acceptable validity and reliability. The findings also suggest lack of significant common methods biases across the jury-collected data, third-party data, and agent-collected data.
Results suggest that Web site success is a first-order construct. Moreover, Web site success is significantly associated with Web site download delay (speed of access and display rate within the Web site), navigation (organization, arrangement, layout, and sequencing), content (amount and variety of product information), interactivity (customization and interactivity), and responsiveness (feedback options and FAQs).},

The current study examined website complexity within the framework of aesthetic theory and psychophysiological research on cognition and emotion. We hypothesized that increasing the complexity of websites would have a detrimental cognitive and emotional impact on users. In a passive viewing task (PVT) 36 website screenshots differing in their degree of complexity (operationalized by JPEG file size; correlation with complexity ratings in a preliminary study

) were presented to 48 participants in randomized order. Additionally, a standardized visual search task (VST) assessing reaction times, and a one-week-delayed recognition task on these websites were conducted and participants rated all websites for arousal and valence. Psychophysiological responses were assessed during the PVT and VST. Visual complexity was related to increased experienced arousal, more negative valence appraisal, decreased heart rate, and increased facial muscle tension (musculus corrugator). Visual complexity resulted in increased reaction times in the VST and decreased recognition rates. Reaction times in the VST were related to increases in heart rate and electrodermal activity. These findings demonstrate that visual complexity of websites has multiple effects on human cognition and emotion, including experienced pleasure and arousal, facial expression, autonomic nervous system activation, task performance, and memory. It should thus be considered an important factor in website design.},

Specifically, how do tourists interact with websites? Which websites transform travelers into repeat visitors? Most research in this field employs multi-item measures conceptualized as reflective models. This paper suggests a theory-based alternative, formative measurement approach for website performance. The construct comprises eight dimensions: system availability, ease of use, usefulness, navigational challenge, website design, content quality, trust, and enjoyment. Website users identify dimensional indicators using evaluation surveys. Structural equation modeling examines linkages between the website performance index and outcome measures (satisfaction, value, and loyalty). Data provided by 455 travelers show the formative index works well. A second sample of 316 respondents cross-validates the findings. The study develops a sound and parsimonious measure allowing the monitoring and benchmarking of traveler perceptions over time.},

abstract = {Manifold learning is a hot research topic in the field of computer science. A crucial issue with current manifold learning methods is that they lack a natural quantitative measure to assess the quality of learned embeddings, which greatly limits their applications to real-world problems. In this paper, a new embedding quality assessment method for manifold learning, named as normalization independent embedding quality assessment (NIEQA) is proposed. Compared with current assessment methods which are limited to isometric embeddings, the NIEQA method has a much larger application range due to two features. First, it is based on a new measure which can effectively evaluate how well local neighborhood geometry is preserved under normalization, hence it can be applied to both isometric and normalized embeddings. Second, it can provide both local and global evaluations to output an overall assessment. Therefore, NIEQA can serve as a natural tool in model selection and evaluation tasks for manifold learning. Experimental results on benchmark data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract="In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a effciency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lknorm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric L(1norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric L(2norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lknorm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.",

Sources of data We searched the available literature using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for relevant articles and abstracts. Areas of agreement Addressing our gaps in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and improving our knowledge of dengue virus biology are necessary in order to develop tools to effectively control, diagnose and treat the disease. Areas of controversy The pathogenesis of dengue is multifactorial and depends on both host and virus factors. A more integrated understanding of disease pathogenesis is necessary. Areas timely for developing research There are many questions related to disease pathogenesis, development of diagnostics, drug and vaccine development and individual case management that need addressing if the disease is to be successfully tackled.},

abstract={Electronic health records (EHRs) provide opportunities to enhance patient care, embed performance measures in clinical practice, and facilitate clinical research. Concerns have been raised about the increasing recruitment challenges in trials, burdensome and obtrusive data collection, and uncertain generalizability of the results. Leveraging electronic health records to counterbalance these trends is an area of intense interest. The initial applications of electronic health records, as the primary data source is envisioned for observational studies, embedded pragmatic or post-marketing registry-based randomized studies, or comparative effectiveness studies. Advancing this approach to randomized clinical trials, electronic health records may potentially be used to assess study feasibility, to facilitate patient recruitment, and streamline data collection at baseline and follow-up. Ensuring data security and privacy, overcoming the challenges associated with linking diverse systems and maintaining infrastructure for repeat use of high quality data, are some of the challenges associated with using electronic health records in clinical research. Collaboration between academia, industry, regulatory bodies, policy makers, patients, and electronic health record vendors is critical for the greater use of electronic health records in clinical research. This manuscript identifies the key steps required to advance the role of electronic health records in cardiovascular clinical research.},

For our searches, we employed the following keywords and their combinations: Electronic health record, implement, obstacle, and information technology in the searching areas of title, keywords, abstract, and full text.
In this study, more than 43 articles and reports were collected and 32 of them were selected based on their relevancy. Many studies indicate that the most important factor than other limitations to implement the EHR are resistance to change.},

abstract="Background: The adoption rate of electronic health records (EHRs) in hospitals has become a main index to measure digitalization in medicine in each country. Objective: This study summarizes and shares the experiences with EHR adoption in China and in the United States. Methods: Using the 2007-2018 annual hospital survey data from the Chinese Health Information Management Association (CHIMA) and the 2008-2017 United States American Hospital Association Information Technology Supplement survey data, we compared the trends in EHR adoption rates in China and the United States. We then used the Bass model to fit these data and to analyze the modes of diffusion of EHRs in these 2 countries. Finally, using the 2007, 2010, and 2014 CHIMA and Healthcare Information and Management Systems Services survey data, we analyzed the major challenges faced by hospitals in China and the United States in developing health information technology. Results: From 2007 to 2018, the average adoption rates of the sampled hospitals in China increased from 18.6{\%} to 85.3{\%}, compared to the increase from 9.4{\%} to 96{\%} in US hospitals from 2008 to 2017. The annual average adoption rates in Chinese and US hospitals were 6.1{\%} and 9.6{\%}, respectively. However, the annual average number of hospitals adopting EHRs was 1500 in China and 534 in the US, indicating that the former might require more effort. Both countries faced similar major challenges for hospital digitalization. Conclusions: The adoption rates of hospital EHRs in China and the United States have both increased significantly in the past 10 years. The number of hospitals that adopted EHRs in China exceeded 16,000, which was 3.3 times that of the 4814 nonfederal US hospitals. This faster adoption outcome may have been a benefit of top-level design and government-led policies, particularly the inclusion of EHR adoption as an important indicator for performance evaluation and the appointment of public hospitals.

abstract={Nowadays, there are molecular biology techniques providing information related to cervical cancer and its cause: the human Papillomavirus (HPV), including DNA microarrays identifying HPV subtypes, mRNA techniques such as nucleic acid based amplification or flow cytometry identifying E6/E7 oncogenes, and immunocytochemistry techniques such as overexpression of p16. Each one of these techniques has its own performance, limitations and advantages, thus a combinatorial approach via computational intelligence methods could exploit the benefits of each method and produce more accurate results. In this article we propose a clinical decision support system (CDSS), composed by artificial neural networks, intelligently combining the results of classic and ancillary techniques for diagnostic accuracy improvement. We evaluated this method on 740 cases with complete series of cytological assessment, molecular tests, and colposcopy examination. The CDSS demonstrated high sensitivity (89.4{\&}{\#}x25;), high specificity (97.1{\&}{\#}x25;), high positive predictive value (89.4{\&}{\#}x25;), and high negative predictive value (97.1{\&}{\#}x25;), for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+). In comparison to the tests involved in this study and their combinations, the CDSS produced the most balanced results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. The proposed system may reduce the referral rate for colposcopy and guide personalised management and therapeutic interventions.},

The main outcome was the onset of severe or critical illness during hospitalisation. Model performances were quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and metrics derived from the confusion-matrix.Results The median age was 50.0 years and 137 (45.8\%) were men in the retrospective cohort. The median age was 62.0 years and 236 (55.4\%) were men in five cohorts. The model was prospectively validated on five cohorts yielding AUCs ranging from 0.84 to 0.89, with accuracies ranging from 74.4\% to 87.5\%, sensitivities ranging from 75.0\% to 96.9\%, and specificities ranging from 57.5\% to 88.0\%, all of which performed better than the pneumonia severity index. The cut-off values of the low, medium, and high-risk probabilities were 0.21 and 0.80. The online-calculators can be found at www.covid19risk.ai.Conclusion The machine-learning model, nomogram, and online-calculator might be useful to access the onset of severe and critical illness among COVID-19 patients and triage at hospital admission.An internationally validated model, nomogram, and online- calculator for severity risk assessment and triage of COVID-19 patients at hospital admission.},

To describe, on the basis of the proceedings of the Evidence and Decision Support track at the 2000 AMIA Spring Symposium, the research and policy challenges for capturing research and practice-based evidence in machine-interpretable repositories, and to present recommendations for accelerating the development and adoption of clinical decision support systems for evidence-based medicine.
The recommendations fall into five broad areas--capture literature-based and practice-based evidence in machine--interpretable knowledge bases; develop maintainable technical and methodological foundations for computer-based decision support; evaluate the clinical effects and costs of clinical decision support systems and the ways clinical decision support systems affect and are affected by professional and organizational practices; identify and disseminate best practices for work flow-sensitive implementations of clinical decision support systems; and establish public policies that provide incentives for implementing clinical decision support systems to improve health care quality.
Although the promise of clinical decision support system-facilitated evidence-based medicine is strong, substantial work remains to be done to realize the potential benefits.},

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},

abstract = {This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

    abstract = "{A locally developed case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm, designed to augment antimicrobial prescribing in secondary care was evaluated.Prescribing recommendations made by a CBR algorithm were compared to decisions made by physicians in clinical practice. Comparisons were examined in 2 patient populations: first, in patients with confirmed Escherichia coli blood stream infections (“E. coli patients”), and second in ward-based patients presenting with a range of potential infections (“ward patients”). Prescribing recommendations were compared against the Antimicrobial Spectrum Index (ASI) and the World Health Organization Essential Medicine List Access, Watch, Reserve (AWaRe) classification system. Appropriateness of a prescription was defined as the spectrum of the prescription covering the known or most-likely organism antimicrobial sensitivity profile.In total, 224 patients (145 E. coli patients and 79 ward patients) were included. Mean (standard deviation) age was 66 (18) years with 108/224 (48\\%) female sex. The CBR recommendations were appropriate in 202/224 (90\\%) compared to 186/224 (83\\%) in practice (odds ratio [OR]: 1.24 95\\% confidence interval [CI]: .392–3.936; P = .71). CBR recommendations had a smaller ASI compared to practice with a median (range) of 6 (0–13) compared to 8 (0–12) (P \\&lt; .01). CBR recommendations were more likely to be classified as Access class antimicrobials compared to physicians’ prescriptions at 110/224 (49\\%) vs. 79/224 (35\\%) (OR: 1.77; 95\\% CI: 1.212–2.588; P \\&lt; .01). Results were similar for E. coli and ward patients on subgroup analysis.A CBR-driven decision support system provided appropriate recommendations within a narrower spectrum compared to current clinical practice. Future work must investigate the impact of this intervention on prescribing behaviors more broadly and patient outcomes.}",
